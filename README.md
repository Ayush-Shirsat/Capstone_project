Pneumonia accounts for 15% deaths of children under the age of 5. Correct detection and localization of Pneumonia is crucial. Diagnonizing requires a review of chest radiography and pneumonia can be detected by observing opacity in a region of lungs. Deep learning can be used to not just detect pneumonia but also localize it in chest images.
